# lab-retreat-2024

Welcome to the moitalab's organization first repository.

So far you have learned how to work on your personal code, both locally and remotely using GitHub.

Now you will learn how to use GitHub to access repositories of other people. 

This repository works as an example.

Inside this repository you will find some data and some analysis scripts to use.

I forgot about this part.
